- Hi, Iâ€™m @zchad25
I am just a normal person who is interested in IT and especially in Cybersecuirity. 
I work in the technical support team in a small IT company and I always try to learn some coding and search for new vulnerabilities.
I still have a long way to go
And by the way, I speak three different languages ( English, German and Arabic ).
