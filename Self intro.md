- Hi, Iâ€™m @zchad25
  
- You'll identify my Coding projects by the Name ZCarcosa
   
I am a Cybersecurity and Networking Specialist who is interested in everything that got something to do with IT.  
I have started my career in Technical Support and Help desk in a small Company and then shifted my career into Networking then diving down into the Cybersecurity field.

Right now people probably identify me as a PenTester, cuz my work is more in offensive security and pentesting than defensive one.

And by the way, I speak three different languages ( English, German and Arabic ).
